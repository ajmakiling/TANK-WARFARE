Project Overview

Tank Warfare

-----Brief Description-----

Tank Warfare is a fast-paced 2-player tank battle game where players fight in a dynamic arena with randomly generated obstacles. Using precise movement, limited ammo, and strategic reload timing, each match becomes a competitive and unpredictable showdown. The game is built entirely with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and PHP.

-----Game Objectives & Win/Lose Conditions-----

Players must shoot and eliminate their opponent using limited ammunition.
Each player starts with 3 hearts.
When a player loses all hearts, the other player wins the match.
Players respawn after being hit, but the arena layout remains intact.
When out of bullets, players must wait 2 seconds to reload.
